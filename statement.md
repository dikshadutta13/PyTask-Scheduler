# Problem Statement

Managing daily tasks becomes difficult when individuals have no simple system to store, track, and update their to-do items.  
People often forget deadlines, miss priorities, or lose track of what tasks are completed or pending.  
There is a need for a lightweight, easy-to-use command-line task scheduler that helps users organize their work efficiently without requiring advanced tools or complex applications.

# Scope of the Project

The PyTask Scheduler project focuses on providing a simple and effective way to manage day-to-day tasks using Python.  
The system allows users to add tasks, view them, update their status, delete tasks, and sort them based on priority or due dates.  
It is designed as a small-scale, menu-driven CLI project ideal for learning Python basics such as lists, functions, conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

The scope is limited to:
- Temporary in-memory task storage (no database)
- Text-based interface only
- Sorting and task management within a monthly time frame
- Single-user operation
